WesPeople 2.0
============================

WesPeople-Rails is a Rails-based application inspired by the original WesPeople
Django project during Wesleyan University's first 36-hour hackathon during May
2013. WesPeople enables members of the Wesleyan community to connect with one
      another , whether they are current students or alumni.

      We want to help connect the network better than WesConnect does so that
      people can have an easier time finding job opportunities!
